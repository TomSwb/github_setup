Hi! Iâ€™m Thomas Schwab.

I started my journey as a developer not too long ago. What drew me to this field is the creativity involved in solving problems, which can ultimately benefit many people. I aspire to enhance my programming skills to a level where I can make a living from them.

The models in my repositories serve as practical examples of what I am learning. I am currently taking my first courses on Mimo.org and using AI as a supplemental tool to learn anything I need. I am careful not to rely solely on AI to code for me; instead, I focus on building my foundational understanding before implementing code in a program I would use. While this approach may take more time, I believe it is essential for ensuring my expertise and professionalism for the sake of my future clients.
